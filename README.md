# 🍞 BabyBread

A web app for choosing a baby's name by having friends and family vote on head-to-head duels between candidate names. Rankings are computed using the [ELO rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), the same algorithm used in chess.

**Live:** https://babyname-e092d.web.app

## What it does

- Anyone with a Google account (or email/password) can join and suggest names for both genders
- Names are presented in one-on-one duels: pick the one you like more
- Each vote updates ELO scores — names that beat strong competition rank higher than names that only beat weak ones
- A global ranking shows the community's consensus; a personal ranking shows each voter's own preferences
- Every voter's ranking is shown independently; the global view averages them all
- Admins can manage users, delete votes, and reset the database

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite |
| UI | Mantine v8 |
| Backend | Firebase (Firestore + Auth) |
| Hosting | Firebase Hosting |

No backend functions — all logic runs client-side against Firestore directly.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # dev server at localhost:5173
npm run build     # TypeScript check + production build
npm run lint      # ESLint
```

Deploying:

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting   # frontend
firebase deploy --only firestore # rules + indexes
```

## How ELO works here

Every name starts at 1000 points. When you vote A over B, points transfer from B to A — the exact amount depends on the rating gap (a surprise upset transfers more than an expected win). K-factor is 32.

Scores are stored per user, so deleting a vote triggers a full replay of that user's remaining match history to recompute accurate ELO from scratch.

## ⚠️ This entire codebase was written by AI

**100% of the code in this repository — including this README — was generated by [Claude Sonnet 4.6](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) (Anthropic), without a single line written by a human.**

### The generation process

- **Engine:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) via [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Anthropic's CLI coding agent
- **Date:** February–March 2026
- **Duration:** ~3 hours of back-and-forth prompting across multiple sessions
- **Method:** Conversational iteration — describe a feature or a fix, Claude reads the relevant files, writes the code, and deploys. No manual code review or editing at any point.

The app was built entirely through natural language instructions: *"add a vote history section"*, *"make the names clickable"*, *"recalculate ELO when a match is deleted"*, and so on. Claude handled architecture decisions, Firestore data modelling, React patterns, Firebase deployment, and everything in between.

### Why mention this?

Because it's remarkable. A complete, deployed, production web app — with real-time sync, ELO math, optimistic UI updates, i18n, admin tooling, and responsive design — built entirely through conversation with a language model in an afternoon. No boilerplate was manually written. No Stack Overflow was consulted. No IDE was opened.

This project exists as a small real-world demonstration of what AI-assisted (or in this case, AI-authored) software development looks like in 2026.
